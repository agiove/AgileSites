You need either the full Oracle WebCenter Sites (available from Oracle WebSite) or Oracle WebCenter Sites JumpStart Kit (available on Oracle Support) to use this framework.

Currently supported versions are  WebCenter Sites version 11.1.1.6.x and 11.1.8.0.

You need also a Java Development Kit (not just the Java Runtime) to use it, version 1.7 or greater. 

Both java, javac and the jar command must be available on path. 

IMPORTANT: the java and javac in the path must be the same used to run JSK or Fatwire/Sites.

If you have Jump Start Kit, to start, just execute either agilesites.cmd or agilesites.sh. It will popup a configurator that will ask for your installation.

If you do not have JumpStart Kit, you can download the full WebCenter Sites installation from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/webcenter/sites/downloads/index.html and place it in the AgileSites main directory, then execute the setup.cmd bat.
